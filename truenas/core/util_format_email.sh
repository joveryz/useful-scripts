# Bash functions to format an email to be sent by the TrueNAS 'sendmail' program.
# TrueNAS 'sendmail' uses a "custom" mail sending program, written in Python by the TrueNAS team.
# I can't make this program work with the Content-Type 'multipart/alternative'.
# And you are required to use the Content-Type: multipart/mixed, even when you have no attachment because the program
# will overwrite your other Content-Type/Transfer-Encoding if it's not set.

# Usage: format_email "Subject" "address@example.com" /path/to/body.html [/path/to/attachment.ext] | sendmail -i -t
